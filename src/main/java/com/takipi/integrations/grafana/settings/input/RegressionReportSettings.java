 * Scoring the reliability of a target application, deployment of tier is done as following:
 *  score = 100 - score_weight * 
 *  	( new_event_score * newEventCount + 
 * 	  severe_new_event_score * severeNewEventCount + 
 * 	  regression_score * (regressionCount + slowdownCount) +
 *  	  severe_regression_score * (severeRegressionCount + severeSlowdownCount))
 *  	  / days_in_time_range)
 * 
 * 	The score is averaged over the number of days within the selected time frame so that if a deployment
 * 	that was introduced yesterday and has already introduced 5 new errors will not receive the same
 *  score as that of one which was introduced a month ago and during that time has only introduced 5
 *  new errors, and as such will be considered more stable.
