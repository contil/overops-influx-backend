 * A function returning a list of rows depicting the volume and rates of calls into

 * Example query:
 * 
 * 		transactionsList({"view":"$view", "timeFilter":"$timeFilter",
 * 		"environments":"$environments","applications":"$applications","servers":"$servers", "deployments":"$deployments", 
 * 		"fields":"link,slow_delta,delta_description,from,to,timeRange,
