/**
 * A function that compares two different combinations of a application/deployment/server
 * filter set, returning events that are either new or have regressed between the different
 * filters. This is especially useful for comparing errors between to different versions.
 * 
 *  Example query:
 *  
 *  eventsDiff({"fields":"link,type,entry_point,introduced_by,jira_issue_url,
 *  		id,rate_desc,diff_desc,diff,message,error_location,stats.hits,rate,
 *  		first_seen,jira_state","view":"$view","timeFilter":"$timeFilter",
 *  		"environments":"$environments","applications":"$applications",
 *  		"servers":"$servers","deployments":"$deployments","volumeType":"all",
 *  		"maxColumnLength":80, "types":"$type","pointsWanted":"$pointsWanted",
 *  		"transactions":"$transactions", "searchText":"$search",
 *  		"compareToApplications":"$compareToApplications", 
 *  		"compareToDeployments":"$compareToDeployments",
 * 		"compareToServers":"$compareToServers", "diffTypes":"Increasing"})
