/** 
 * A function returning a report for a a target set of applications, deployments or tiers (i.e. categories)
 * listing an possible new errors, increases (i.e. regressions) and slowdowns. The function can return
 * either a tabular report or a chart, where a key selected value from each row is used as the Y value
 * and the name of the target app, deployment, tier is used as the X value. The decisions regarding
 * which events are new, regressing and which transactions have slowdowns are governed by the 
 * regression and transaction setting available in the Settings dashboard.
 *
 * Example query for table:
 * 		regressionReport({"timeFilter":"$timeFilter","environments":"$environments",
 * 		"applications":"$applications","servers":"$servers","deployments":"$deployments",
 * 		"view":"$view","pointsWanted":"$pointsWanted", "transactionPointsWanted":"$transactionPointsWanted",
 * 		"types":"$type", "render":"Grid", "mode":"Tiers", "limit":"$limit", 
 * 		"sevAndNonSevFormat":"%d  (%d p1)", "sevOnlyFormat":"%d p1"})
 * 
 * Example query for graph:
 * 
 * 		regressionReport({"timeFilter":"$timeFilter","environments":"$environments",
 * 		"applications":"$applications","servers":"$servers","deployments":"$deployments",
 * 		"view":"$view","pointsWanted":"$pointsWanted", "transactionPointsWanted":"$transactionPointsWanted",
