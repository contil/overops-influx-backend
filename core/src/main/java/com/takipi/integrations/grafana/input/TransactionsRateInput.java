 * A function used to return a single stat depicting the rate between calls into a target set of events entry points

 * Example query:
 * 		transactionsRate({"type":"sum","volumeType":"invocations","view":"$view",
 * 		"timeFilter":"$timeFilter","environments":"$environments", "applications":"$applications",
